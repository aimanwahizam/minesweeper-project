# minesweeper-project
Game project for _nology Week 3 - JS, HTML and CSS

## Dev notes
(*FOR LATER*)

Should be a grid
  Make grid 16x16 for now 
    *CAN ADD OTHER DIFFICULTIES I.E. SMALLER AND BIGGER GRIDS*

Grid should either:
  1. be empty
  2. have a bomb
  3. or a number

User should be able to put a flag on a grid 

If user presses a grid slot with a bomb - game will end
If user presses a grid slot with no bomb - either show blank or empty
  *IF THERES A CONNECTED SERIES OF BLANKS OR NUMBERS AUTOMATICALLY SHOW*

On start button click, randomly generates x amount of bombs to be in grid 
  Then generate where numbers will go 
    blanks will fill the rest - so by default its blank
    
*ADD TIMER AND COUNTER*
